##CHVirtualChests...
######... so you can have your chest and stash it too.

CHVirtualChests (aka CHVC) is a virtual chest implementation for CommandHelper, leveraging the extension system built in for this purpose.

CHVC primarily leverages functions to accomplish it's goals, but includes two events as well.

You can find the documentation [here][docs]. Please report any issues to the [bug tracker][issues]. If you need any help, join us on IRC at `irc.esper.net`. We hang out in the `#commandhelper` channel.
